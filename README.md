# Todo List App with React.js + TypeScript

This is a web and mobile to-do list application implemented using **React.js** and **TypeScript**.

- **Edit a Todo**: Existing todos can be edited and updated as needed.
- **Delete a Todo**: Users have the option to remove completed or unnecessary todos.
- **View All Todos**: The app displays a list of all the todos.
- **Pagination**: To manage a large number of todos, the list is paginated for better user experience.
